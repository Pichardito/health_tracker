Welcome to HealthTracker, a site where doctors can keep track of patients' health outcomes.

You can visit HealthTracker on the web at http://health-tracker.herokuapp.com/.

Doctors are able to log in to their HealthTracker account and register patients' vital signs and important indicators such as their cholesterol level, H1C, triglycerides, and more in an effort to comply with upcoming pay models that reward them for quality of care instead of quantity of care.

In addition, doctors are able to visualize key indicators per patient thereby getting 'the big picture' of the evolution of their patients' health.
